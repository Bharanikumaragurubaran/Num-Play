# Num-Play
Similar to Wordle, but here we will be guessing 4 digit number.
# Setup
Simple python game, it can be played using updated python version.
# Motivation
Before developing this game, I developed Wordle game using Python (which can be found in https://github.com/Bharanikumaragurubaran/Wordle.git)
While developing Wordle I was thinking what if we developed similar game to guess numbers, it got me all curious and excited!!!
This game is result of my excitement.
